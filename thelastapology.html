    <h1>Apology to My Parents</h1>
    <p>Dear Mom and Dad,</p>
    <p>I am so sorry for my actions and for any trouble I may have caused. I know how much I hurt you and I want to make it right. .</p> I know you were worried and I feel terrible for causing you any stress. I understand how important it is for me to be responsible and keep you informed about my whereabouts.

    The truth is, I lost track of time and didn't realize how late it was getting. I should have called to let you know, and I'm truly sorry for not doing so. I promise that in the future, I will make a better effort to keep you informed and stay on schedule.
    
    Thank you for understanding and for always being there for me. I appreciate your love and support, and I hope you can forgive me for coming home late from basketball.
    
    Sincerely,</p>
    <p>With all my love,</p>
    <p>Tawana</p>
